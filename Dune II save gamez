  Assistance please,
  
  As an owner of the CD Dune 2,ooo, I was pleasantly pleased when I found this Dune II online.
  My problem lies in loading a saved game from most PC systems I have tried, no trouble from MAC thus far.  After logging in and
    clicking load new game, I see the list of saved games I have placed.  Yet when clicking on either file, I get no response.

My user name here is Sir-Domaine, I can also be reached $1r.D0ma1n3@gmail.com.  Would sure like to see a resolution to this issue.

  ps. Apologizes, found nowhere else on the website to post general comments.  Also, I speak not the language of the programmerz
    website.
    
  pss. From curiousity, how long has Dune been available to be played online ?
